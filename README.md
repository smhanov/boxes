# boxes
Demo for DevHouse tech talk on Cassowary algorithm 

I created the Box class which represents a rectangle and has functions like "alignLeft", "sameWidth", etc. This is a very thin wrapper over Cassowary.js, from https://github.com/slightlyoff/cassowary.js/ and you can use it as an example for its equation syntax.
